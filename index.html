            <p class ="info"> Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls,
            without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure
            footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls.</p>

            <p class ="info"> Sport climbing is a form of rock climbing that relies on permanent anchors fixed to the rock for protection. 
            This is in contrast to traditional climbing where climbers must place removable protection as they climb. Sport climbing emphasises strength,
            endurance, gymnastic ability and technique, over adventure, risk and self-sufficiency.For the majority of sport climbers, sport climbing
            offers an easier, more convenient experience which requires less equipment, less in the way of technical skills required to be safe during
            the climb, and lower levels of mental stress than traditional climbing.</p><br>

            <h2 class ="title"> Deep Water Soloing</h2>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uwzfeS7.jpg"/>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>Chris Sharam climbing and falling over a deep water solo route in Mallorca, Spain.</p>
            <p class ="info"> Deep-water soloing (DWS), also known as psicobloc, is a form of solo rock climbing that relies solely upon the 
               presence of water at the base of a climb to protect against injury from fallings from the generally high difficulty routes.
               While typically practiced on sea cliffs at high tide, it can also be done on climbs above reservoirs, rivers, 
               and even swimming pools.</p>
